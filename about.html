                  <h3>Early Life</h3>
                  <p>Born in 9th July 2002 Ankara, Turkey. Since I was just a little kid, I have always wanted to become
                    an inventor. Getting my hands dirty and imagining and creating things was my passion. When I was 8,
                    I invented my first significant project, Bul-Bul. It was designed to locate an object in the house
                    by giving the exact location of the item on the map of the house. I was quite a messy kid, and I
                    lost my stuff every once in a while. I won first prize at my school's science fair with this
                    invention. I have kept my designs and inventions in my book. The best thing about studying EEE is
                    that I can implement those designs in real life! I love electronics and microcontrollers since they
                    enable me to do great stuff.</p>
                  <h3>Education </h3>
                  <p>From kindergarden to highschool, I was studied at METU Foundation Schools. I participated in many activities and
                    competitions there. Some of the many are annual science fairs, voluntary social works, sports
                    tournaments, and choir festivals(national & international). However, the most significant was my
                    summer research internship at the Mechanical Engineering Department at Koc University. There I got
                    accustomed to 3d modeling and design, and they became one of my long-lasting passions.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm a 3rd Year EEE student at Bilkent University. I'm an undergraduate researcher at
                    Bilkent Miniature Robotics Lab. I worked as a tutor for PHYS102 and EEE212 Microprocessors courses.
                    Besides academic work, I have been an active member of the Bilkent Young Entrepreneur Society and
                    Bilkent TDP. In TDP, we organized an event with middle school children in Kars, to which we played
                    educational games together.

                  <p>
                    Playing Volleyball, Singing, Gaming, Electronics, 3d Modelling, RC Vehicles</p>
